# Calculator

> A (very) simple (somewhat working) calculator made in vanilla JS/CSS/HTML!
> This is the final tutorial of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/)'s foundations course.

It has amazing features such as:

- insults you if you're foolish enough to divide by zero
- keyboard support
- can add numbers together!
- that's all what do you expect it's a calculator. it wont wash your dishes or smth lmao
